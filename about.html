      <h1 class="tag name">About the Baker</h1>

      <div class="col1">
        <p class="body">Jay started baking cookies with her grandma, every christmas, when she was younger. That's one of the first memories Jay has of baking. Peanut butter, chocolate chip, sugar, thumbprint cookies and more.</p>
        
        
        <p class="body">During college, Jay baked as a means of releiving stress. It turned out she actually had some pretty mad skills in the kitchen. After college, Jay really delved into baking-- a chocolate cake with chocolate icing opened the door to the beauty of baking from scratch. The kitchen-aid she got for Christmas one year only fueled the fire.</p>
       
        
        <p class="body">It started with chocolate cake, then grew into buttercream, breads, curds, tarts, meringues, and more. Check out the <a href="menu.html">menu</a> to take a look for yourself.</p>
